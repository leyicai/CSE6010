Description
-------------

In this program, a priority queue with 20 elements is generated.
The key and data of each element is generated as random numbers.
Several functions to modify the priority queue are tested in the
program, including insertion, deletion and counting element 
numbers. At last, the address used for the priority queue is freed.


Installation
------------

To install, simply run

    gcc main.c Function.c -std=c99 -o A1C

Note: The -std=c99 flag is required on some C compilers
to allow variable declarations at arbitrary locations in
a function.

Execution
-----------

Assuming your executable is called "A1C", run it using

    ./A1C
