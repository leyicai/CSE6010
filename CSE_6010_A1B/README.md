Description
-------------

This program is to calculate the product of two matrice. It first
create two matrix with random values between 0.0 to 10.0 using dynamic allocation. 
Matrix A is n1 * n2 and Matrix B is n2 * n3. Then calculate Matrix C = A * B. 
All matrices will be print out.


Installation
------------

To install, simply run

    gcc main.c Functions.c -std=c99 -o A1B

Note: The -std=c99 flag is required on some C compilers
to allow variable declarations at arbitrary locations in
a function.

Execution
-----------

Assuming your executable is called "A1B", run it using

    ./A1B
