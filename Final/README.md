Description
-------------
This program is used to compute the integral of an arbitrary function f(x). Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to compute the value of the integral. The simulation repeats N times and the result Z will be printed on screen along with N.

Installation
------------

To install the first program, simply run

    gcc main.c -std=c11 -o integral


Execution
-----------

Assuming the your executable is called "integral", run it using

    ./integral
